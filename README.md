# Why ?<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

**Becuase** 
-   We should not be using 10 different apps just to be productive, which in-turn are making us inefficient.
-   One solid solid software solution to make users productive.
-   It is not, yet another TODO app.

# How<a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a>

**BY**
-   Reusing the user data. e.g if a user has marked, **TODO** as complete, that should be automatically be imported to the journal/diary.
-   If a user has tasks list and he wants to **run pomodoro**, he is not required to open another app.
-   extensive use of guesture and prediction modelling according to user behaviour.
-   Comes with assistance feature like google photos.

Productive is basically a software solution which acts as one stop solution for being productive. The main idea behind the project is, that daily activities are related and they determine the overall productivity rather than them all being isolated.
